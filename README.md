Classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using a Support Vector Machine.
1. EXPLORING THE DATA
2. SPLIT, STANDARDIZATION
3. CREATE, FIT AND TEST THE MODEL (only results of two kernels are shown here, linear and rbf)
4. CROSS VALIDATION USING "for" LOOP FOR SPLITING THE DATA
5. USING FUNCTION K-FOLD CROSS VALIDATION
6. PARAMETERS TUNING USING "for" LOOP
7. USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS FOR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION AND VISUALIZATION
