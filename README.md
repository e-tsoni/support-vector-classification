# support-vector-classification

Classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using a Support Vector Machine.
1. exploring the data
2. split, standardization
3. create, fit and test the model (only results of two kernels are shown here, linear and rbf)
4. cross validation using "for" loop for spliting the data
5. using function k-fold cross validation (same results as 4.)
6. parameters tuning using "for" loop
7. using principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and visualization

Pending: Visualize the relationship and the correlation between our features.
